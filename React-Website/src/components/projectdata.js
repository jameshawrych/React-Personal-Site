        description:"Sepsis is a life threatening organ dysfunction that occurs due to the bodyâ€™s response to infection. Severe cases of sepsis lead to septic shock and death. As such there is great interest in automatically predicting sepsis in patients so that clinicians can react earlier. This project aims to develop a framework for the automatic prediction of sepsis incorporating path signatures, and compare the effectiveness of traditional machine learning and deep learning methods for this problem.",
