      description: "I work as a Software Engineer specialising in Data Engineering and in particular developing machine learning pipelines.",
      bulletpoint1: "I developed a Python based API to allow for serving of machine learning models. I also created high quality production data pipelines in Python/PySpark to enable machine learning model training.",
      bulletpoint2: "I set up advanced CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins/Maven to allow for improvements and deployments to be easily made to the codebase. While designing the pipeline I followed DevOps and MLOps principles to, for example, allow for continuous training of models.",
      bulletpoint3: "I designed a GCP architecture based on user requirements that provides a state of the art data discovery environment, as well as an environment in which to train machine learning models. This will allow users to more rapidly create and prototype machine learning models.",
      bulletpoint4: "I created reuasable Python packages that were uploaded to an internal repository/artifact store for use. I then provided assitance to help other people do the same.",
